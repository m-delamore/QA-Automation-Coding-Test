QA Automation Coding Test
This is my submission for the test. I am not able to make endpoints that are provided from an API with a url, if that is what is required. Instead, I've put them into function bodies. Due to my coding capabilities, I hope this is okay.

Prerequisites
- Node.js

Installation and Usage
The following are the steps to clone the repository and run the mocha test scripts.

1. Clone the repository using the git command:

If your computer has 'git' installed, type in the following command into the terminal. You may want to change to your desired directories.

git clone https://github.com/m-delamore/QA-Automation-Coding-Test.git

Otherwise, you can go here https://github.com/m-delamore/QA-Automation-Coding-Test and download the zip file.

2. Navigate to the directory where the project was cloned/installed in the terminal using the cd command:

cd path\to\directory

3. To run the test scripts, use the following command in the terminal while still in the project directory:

npx mocha testEndpoints.js
